      "Sachs. Our risk management  framework, consistent with that of Goldman Sachs, is built around three core \n",
      "components: governance, processes and people. \n",
      "Governance.   \n",
      "Risk management governance starts with the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (“Board”), which both \n",
      "directly and through its committees,  including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies \n",
      "and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framewo rk. The Board is also \n",

      "(iii) risk reporting and monitoring , and (iv) risk decision-making.  \n",
      " Risk Identification and Assessment.  We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a \n",
      "critical step in providing our Boar d and senior management transparency and insight into the range and \n",
      "materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensiv e data collection process, including firmwide policies \n",
      "and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk \n",
      "identification and assessment is comp rehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to \n",
      "reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter \n",
      "expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks.  \n",
      "To effectively assess our risks, we maintain a dail y discipline of marking s ubstantially all of our \n",
      "inventory to current market levels. We carry our in ventory at fair value, with changes in valuation \n",
      "reflected immediately in our risk management sy stems and in net revenues. We do so because we \n",
      "believe this discipline is one of the most eff ective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it \n",
      "provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.  \n",
      "An important part of our risk management process is fi rmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our \n",
      "exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss con centrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess \n",
      "and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress te sts are performed on a regular basis and are designed \n",
      "to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerab ilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and \n",
      "nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, cr edit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and \n",
      "compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks in to a single combined scenar io. We also perform ad \n",
      "hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or  conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital \n",
      "adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process.  \n",
      " Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.  We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds \n",
      "to control and monitor risk across transactions, prod ucts, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or \n",
      "indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves lim its and thresholds included in our risk appetite \n",
      "statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In  addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee \n",
      "is responsible for approving our risk limits framework , subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk \n",
      "Committee of the Board, a nd monitoring these limits.  \n",
      " \n",
      "54  The Risk Governance Committee is re sponsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product \n",
      "levels. Certain limits may be set at le vels that will require periodic adjust ment, rather than at levels that \n",
      "reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and \n",
      "second lines of defense, committees and senior manageme nt, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related \n",
      "matters. Additionally, through delega ted authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk \n",
      "sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, \n",
      "counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries an d countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and \n",
      "amended on a permanent or temporary basis to re flect changing market conditions, business conditions \n",
      "or risk tolerance.  \n",
      " Risk Reporting and Monitoring.  Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our \n",
      "ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such , we focus on the rigor \n",
      "and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management \n",
      "technology systems provide us with complete, accura te and timely information. Our risk reporting and \n",
      "monitoring processes are designed to take into acc ount information about both existing and emerging \n",
      "risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senio r management to perform their responsibilities with \n",
      "the appropriate level of insight into risk expos ures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach \n",
      "processes provide means for timely escalation. We ev aluate changes in our risk profile and our \n",
      "businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisd ictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk \n",
      "factors at a firmwide level. \n",
      " Risk Decision-Making.  Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-\n",
      "making on risk management issues and ensures implem entation of those decisions. We make extensive \n",
      "use of risk committees that meet regularly and ser ve as an important means to facilitate and foster \n",
      "ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.  \n",
      "We maintain strong and proactive co mmunication about risk and we have  a culture of collaboration in \n",
      "decisionmaking among our first and second lines of de fense, committees and senior management. While \n",
      "our first line of defense is responsible for manageme nt of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to \n",
      "our second line of defense in order to ensure a str ong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation \n",
      "of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong cultur e of escalation and accountability across all functions. \n",
      "People.  Even the best technology serves only as a tool for he lping to make informed decisions in real time \n",
      "about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our  people to interpret our \n",
      "risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust  risk positions accordingly. In both our revenue-\n",
      "producing units and our i ndependent control and su pport functions, the experience of our professionals, \n",
      "and their understanding of the nua nces and limitations of each risk measure, guide us in assessing \n",
      "exposures and maintaining them  within prudent levels.  \n",
      "We reinforce a culture of effective risk management in our training and development programs as well as \n",

      "investment opportunities. Since these positions are account ed for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily \n",
      "basis, with the related gains and losses included in th e consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a \n",
      "variety of risk measures, each described in the r espective sections below, to  monitor market risk. \n",
      "Categories of market risk include the following: \n",
      " Interest rate risk: results from exposures to cha nges in the level, slope and curvature of yield \n",

      " Diversifying exposures; \n",
      " Controlling position sizes;  \n",
      " Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives; and \n",
      "Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of VaR and stress \n",

      "Value-at-Risk \n",
      "VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a \n",
      "specified confidence level. We typically employ a on e-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We \n",
      "use a single VaR model which captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and \n",
      "commodity prices. As such, VaR fac ilitates comparison across portfolios of  different risk characteristics. \n",
      "VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk across GS&Co. \n",
      "We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and th erefore use a variety of risk measures in our market \n",

      " VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer ti me horizons where moves may be extreme; \n",
      " \n",
      "67   VaR does not take account of the relative li quidity of different risk positions; and  \n",
      " Previous moves in market risk factors may not pr oduce accurate predictions of all future market \n",
      "moves. \n",
      "To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant  risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical \n",
      "simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by si multaneously shocking the \n",
      "relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding \n",
      "spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the \n",
      "composition of positions, as well as variations in ma rket conditions. We sample from five years of \n",
      "historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calc ulation. The historical data is weighted so that the \n",
      "relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent \n",
      "observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of \n",
      "potential loss. As a result, even if our positions in cluded in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase \n",
      "with increasing market volatility and vice versa. \n",
      " \n",
      "Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most e ffective in estimating risk exposures in markets in \n",
      "which there are no sudden fundamental cha nges or shifts in market conditions. \n",
      "Our VaR measure does not include: \n",
      " Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and \n",

      " Stress Testing Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress \n",
      "testing to examine risks of specifi c portfolios as well as the potential im pact of significant risk exposures \n",
      "across Goldman Sachs, and the imp act specifically on GS&Co. We use a variety of stress testing \n",

      "See “Overview” for information about firmwide \n",
      "stress tests.  \n",
      "Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of  a market move in a single risk factor across all \n",

      " \n",
      "68  Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of  a specified event, includ ing how the event impacts \n",
      "multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct \n",

      "scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are \n",
      "constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. \n",
      "Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied proba bility because they are calculated at a specified \n",
      "confidence level, there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. Instead, \n",
      "stress tests are used to model both moderate and more  extreme moves in underlying market factors. When \n",
      "estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be re duced or hedged (although \n",

      " We use credit limits at various leve ls, as well as underwriting standards to control the size and nature of \n",
      "our credit exposures. Limits for counterparties and econom ic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to \n",
      "reflect changing risk appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, \n",

      "We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the cred it exposures, including potential concentrations that \n",
      "would result from applying shocks to counterparty cred it ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, \n",
      "interest rates, equity prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market \n",
      "movements. Some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence \n",
      "of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sove reign default, we estimate the direct impact of the \n",
      "default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to  our credit exposures arising from potential market \n",
      "moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and \n",
      "counterparties that may result from the sovereign defa ult. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated \n",
      "within a specified confidence level,  with a stress test there is gene rally no assumed probability of these \n",
      "events occurring.  \n",
      " \n",
      "To supplement these regular stress tests, as desc ribed above, we also con duct tailored stress tests \n",

      "these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country \n",
      "exposures, such as the impact of credit mark et deterioration on co rporate borrowers and \n",
      "counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. Th e parameters of these \n",
      "shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses \n",

      "us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or con tingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the \n",
      "counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified leve l. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to \n",

      "Unless otherwise agreed, we are acting in the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty to you in connection with the Transaction and do not undertake to act as your financial or other advisor (including a “municipal advisor” within the meaning of \n",
      "Section  15B of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934), agent, representative, or fiduciary.  \n",
      "Accordingly, unless we have agreed to act in one of the foregoing roles you should:  \n",
      "• not regard any Transacti on proposals, suggestions or other written or oral \n",
      "communications from us as advice or a recommendation or otherwise as \n",
      "expressing our view as to whether a  Transaction is appropriate for you or meets \n",
      "your financial or other objectives;  \n",
      "• determine whether y ou have the necessary information to understand the terms \n",

      "• assume we have an economic incentive to be a counterparty to any Transacti on \n",
      "with you. \n",
      "We and/or our affiliates may engage in business with you in capacities other than as counterparty to Transactions.  Such other capacities might include acting as your broker or futures commission merchant in executing orde rs for securities, fu tures contracts,  \n",
      "swaps, security -based swaps,  providing clearing or custody services, acting as a lender, \n",
      "providing banking services to you, acting as underwriter, placement or remarketing agent with respect to securities issued or purchased by you, managi ng investments, acting as a \n",
      "municipal advisor, collateral valuation agent, data provider or any of the other relevant capacities in which we or an affiliate may act in financial or commercial markets, as described in Section IV.A below. \n",
      "There are important  differences in the nature of our relationship when we act as \n",
      "counterparty to Transactions, as distinguished from the various other capacities in which \n",
      "we or our affiliates may act.  As counterparty to Transactions, we enter into the Transactions as princi pal, and our interests are directly adverse to yours when we \n",
      "negotiate the terms of a Transaction or related documentation, or make determinations or exercise our rights thereunder.  In contrast, in some other capacities, the primary purpose of our or our affiliate’s relationship with you may be to facilitate your transacting with other parties as principal, provide advice, or hold financial assets on your behalf.  We or an affiliate may also act as your counterparty in contractual arrangements that are not  \n",
      "Transactions.  In such cases, other applicable laws, regulations, internal policies or procedures, or rules of a self -regulatory organization may govern matters such as the \n",
      " \n",
      "6 \n",
      " handling and execution of orders, standards of care, disclosure of information, conflicts \n",
      "of interest, fees and compensation or the segregation and control of assets held for safekeeping on your behalf.  The duties and standards to which we or an affiliate are subject when acting in such other capacities may differ materially from those  that apply \n",
      "when we act as counterparty to Transactions, and may (or may not) afford substantially greater protections to you.  When we act in a particular capacity, we shall have only the duties and responsibilities that pertain specifically to that capac ity. \n",
      "You should consult appropriate advisors for  assistance in evaluating and understanding \n",
      "the terms or risks of a  Transaction or the legal, tax and accounting requirements and \n",
      "results of entering into the Transaction, you should consult appropriate advis ors.     \n",
      "B. You should review carefully each Transaction’s particular structure, including terms incorporated by reference  \n",
      " The Transactions result from agreements between two “counterparties” and generally involve an exchange or a series of exchanges of payments or deliveries, which may be calculated by reference to a notional or principal amount or quantity and a price, value, level or rate of return of one or more Underliers.  The Transactions may be structured in various forms including, but not limited to, forwards, swaps, options (including so -called \n",
      "vanilla and exotic options), swaptions, caps, floors, collars or variations of these components , including embedded optionality, as well as combinations of these \n",
      "components  with other compone nts and non- derivative products .  You should be aware \n",
      "that there is risk associated with each component of a multi -component Transaction, \n",
      "as well as with the Transaction as a whole.  \n",
      "The confirmation or other communication evidencing a Transaction, or a governing \n",
      "master agreement, may incorporate by reference various standard definitions, annexes and supplements thereto, master confirmation agreements  and other market standard \n",
      "terms, which may in turn be amended or customized pursuant to the terms of a Trans action and its governing documentation.  In some cases, the provisions of a prime \n",
      "brokerage agreement or the rules of a swap execution facility, security -based swap \n",
      "execution facility, confirmation platform or other provider of execution, clearing, confirm ation or portfolio compression services may deem certain provisions to be \n",
      "incorporated into Transactions entered into or processed through such arrangements or services.  In the case of Transactions executed between us that are accepted for clearing (“cleared Transactions ”), the rules, by- laws and procedures of the clearinghouse will \n",
      "govern the cleared Transaction and define its terms.  Under certain circumstances, the specifications of outstanding cleared Transactions (such as the exercise price of an option) may be modified by the clearinghouse to reflect changes in the Underlier.  Before \n",
      "entering into any Transaction, you should obtain and review carefully any such materials incorporated by reference and, in the case of cleared Transactions, the disclosur es, if any, \n",
      "provided by your clearing broker and the relevant clearinghouses, as well as the applicable clearinghouse rules, by -laws and procedures, as their content could materially \n",
      "affect your rights and obligations under the Transaction, its value and i ts appropriateness \n",
      "for your particular objectives.   \n",
      " \n",
      "7 \n",
      "  C. Transactions generally involve a variety of risks  \n",
      "The specific risks presented by a particular Transaction necessarily depend upon the \n",
      "terms of the Transaction and your circumstances.  In general, however, all Transactions involve one or more of the following risks — credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, funding risk, operational risk, legal and documentation risk, regulatory risk and/or tax risk.  Each of these risks is discussed below in Section  III of this General Disclosure \n",
      "Statement.  The structures of the Transactions are frequently customized by the parties to accomplish specific financial, tax, accounting, or asset, liability or risk management objectives, and the resulting risks of each Tr ansaction necessarily depend upon the terms \n",
      "of the Transaction and your present and future circumstances. There can be no assurances that these objectives will be met.   \n",
      "D. Value of the Transactions is derived from one or more Underliers and other market an d economic factors  \n",
      "Depending upon the nature of the Transactions, payments and/or deliveries under the Transactions may be calculated by reference to one or more Underliers and may arise upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances, the satisfact ion of certain \n",
      "conditions, or the exercise of certain rights.  The value of Transactions may depend on prices, values, or levels of the Underliers and other market and economic factors discussed in greater detail in Part III below.  \n",
      "Except for certain prop rietary structures, the prices, values, or levels of an Underlier are \n",
      "determined in the market for that Underlier.  You should be aware that each market for an \n",
      "Underlier has its own particular characteristics and risks, including, to the extent \n",
      "applicable, the market’s institutional structure, trading rules, market practices, liquidity, \n",
      "governance, regulation (or lack thereof) and participants.  The terms of a Transaction may refer to such features and allocate or otherwise provide for associated risks.  \n",
      "Alternatively, there may be known or anticipated eventualities that could affect a market \n",
      "that are not provided for in the terms of a Transaction or its governing documentation.  \n",
      "Before you enter into any Transaction, you should review the publicly available information regarding the market characteristics and risks pertaining to the relevant Underliers, review all the disclosure we have provided that is relevant to Transactions in such Underliers, and (as you may deem appropriate) consult advisors with specif ic \n",
      "expertise regarding the markets for such Underliers and the Transaction.  \n",
      "1. Past Performance  \n",
      "Neither we nor you can predict the future performance of an Underlier based on historical performance. The price, value, or level of the Underlier over the term of a Transaction may bear little or no relation to the historical price, value, or level of the Underlier. Prior observed patterns, if any, in the behavior of market variables, such as correlations, may  change in the future .  In addition, the source \n",
      "or method of determining the price, value, or level of the Underlier as may be provided in the governing documentation may be subject to market factors or may \n",
      " \n",
      "8 \n",
      " change or cease to be available during the term of a Transaction . Such matters \n",
      "may or may not be addressed in the governing documentation. \n",
      "If the Underlier for a Transaction is an index,  the Underlier may not have a \n",
      "performance history. If we provide you with a  hypothetical historical performance \n",
      "analysis  of an index, you should be aware that any such analysis i nherently \n",
      "involves assumptions, estimates and approximations.  You should also understand \n",
      "that the future performance of the index is impossible to predict and therefore no \n",
      "future performance of the index  or any Transaction may be i nferred from any of \n",
      "the historical simulations.  H ypothetical performance data are  not indicative of, \n",
      "and have  no bearing on, the potential performance of the index or any \n",
      "Transaction.   See Part III.O below.  \n",
      "2. Different Currencies  \n",
      "For certain Transactions , the prices, values, or levels of the Underliers may be \n",
      "denominated in currencies other than the settlement or payment currency and may be converted to the settlement or payment currency for purposes of determining payments or deliveries to be made under the Transactions. Such Transactions will be exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to each of the currencies in which an Underlier or obligation is denominated. Your net exposure to this risk will depend on the extent to which the currencies of the Underliers for a relevant Transaction strengthen or weaken against the settlement currency or one another.  The Transaction may provide for allocation of this risk between the parties . \n",
      "Fluctuations in the currencies of the Underliers may adversely impact the values of the Transactions and the payments or deliveries to be made or received thereunder.  \n",
      "3. Changes in the components of baskets or indices \n",
      "If the Underlier for a Transaction is a basket or index, the negative performance of one or more compon ents of the basket or index may negate any positive \n",
      "performance of other components.  For example, while the prices, values, or levels of some components may increase over the term of the Transaction, the prices, values, or levels of other components may not increase during the term of the Transaction to the same extent  or may decline. Therefore, in respect of the \n",
      "value of the Transaction or the amount of any payments or deliveries to be made under the Transaction, changes in the prices, value, or levels of  one or more of the \n",
      "components may be moderated, or offset, by lesser changes or inverse changes in the prices, values, or levels of one or more of the other components.  This effect may be further amplified by differing weights of each component.  More he avily \n",
      "weighted components will have a larger impact on the value of the Transaction or the amount of any payments or deliveries to be made under  the Transaction than \n",
      "components with lesser weightings. Changes may also be made in accordance \n",
      "with an index’s underlying methodology or after the occurrence of future events.  \n",
      " \n",
      "9 \n",
      " E. Entering into a Transaction is not equivalent to investment in or ownership \n",
      "of the Underlier  \n",
      "Unless specifically provided for in the terms of a Transaction or governing \n",
      "documentation, a Transaction will not confer ownership rights  or any beneficial or legal \n",
      "interest in any Underlier, including without limitation any stock, fund, partnership \n",
      "interest, note, bond, security, loan or other instrument of indebtedness, foreign exchange rate, currency, commodity, futures contract, or other asset, index or  financial measure \n",
      "underlying a Transaction  or underlying an index that is the Underlier for a Transaction .  \n",
      "Thus, a  Transaction will not confer voting rights, rights to receive interest, dividends or \n",
      "other distributions, rights to approve a restructuring or plan of reorganization, enforcement rights, transfer rights or any other rights or residual interest that having an ownership interest in the Underlier may confer, unless othe rwise agreed.  \n",
      "The exposure of an index to its components is purely notional  and will exist solely in the \n",
      "records maintained by or on behalf of the index calculation agent.  With an index, t here is \n",
      "no actual portfolio of assets to which any person is entitl ed or in which any person has \n",
      "any ownership interest .  Unless specifically provided for under  the terms of a Transaction \n",
      "or governing documentation, a  counterparty to  a Transaction with  an index Underlier  will \n",
      "not have the rights that investors in the inde x components may have  and will not have an \n",
      "ownership interest  or have any beneficial or other legal interest in, or  be entitled to any \n",
      "rights with respect to, any of the index components.  \n",
      "F. The economic return of a Transaction may not be the same as the r eturn \n",
      "from the Underlier  \n",
      "The mathematical relationship between the payments and deliveries under a Transaction \n",
      "and the price, level or value of the Underliers will be specified under each Transaction or its governing documentation, and in general there is no reason to expect that the \n",
      "economic return of a  Transaction will be equivalent to, or correlated to that of an \n",
      "investment in the Underlier.  Even if a Transaction is a total return swap, contract for \n",
      "differences, credit default swap, or similar instrumen t that you have entered into for the \n",
      "purpose of obtaining the equivalent of a long or short position in or exposure to an Underlier, the economic return of the Transaction may not be the same as the return from the Underlier.  Such divergences may occur due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:  \n",
      "• Payments or deliveries under a Transaction may be determined based on the \n",
      "prices, values, or levels of the Underlier only at specified observation or valuation \n",
      "times;  \n",
      "• The Transaction may apply inter im compounding to rates of return observed for \n",
      "the Underlier over shorter periods than the term of the Transaction;  \n",
      "• The Transaction terms may include or reflect an adjustment for fees or commissions, financing charges, hedging costs or breakage costs;  \n",
      " \n",
      "10 \n",
      " • The tax or accounting treatment, and the  legal, tax and accounting requirements \n",
      "and results , of the Transaction may differ significantly from owning the \n",
      "Underlier;  \n",
      "• The Transaction may not provide the same rights to  unwind or transfer the \n",
      "Transaction as direct  ownership of the Underlier would allow in deciding when \n",
      "and how to dispose of the Underlier;  \n",
      "• The price source or valuation methodology under the Transaction may yield a \n",
      "different value than would be realized by disposing of the Underlier in financial or physical markets for such Underlier;  \n",
      "•  The Transaction may include optionality, cancellation, “barrier,” leverage or other similar features that may give disproportionate effect to changes in prices, values, or levels or other factors; and/or  \n",
      "• The Transaction may contain terms providing for adjustments, early termination \n",
      "or cancellation due to corporate events, disruption of our ability to hedge in \n",
      "relevant  markets, changes in law or other extraordinary events.   \n",
      "Accordingly, changes in prices, values, or levels of an Underlier may not result in a comparable payment or delivery under , or change in the value of, the Transaction.  If the \n",
      "price, value, or level of the Underlier for a Transaction has increased on any day, the value of the Transaction on such day may not increase comparably, if at all. Such \n",
      "changes in value may vary throughout the day and differ based on the time of valuation. It is also possible for the price, value, or level of an Underlier to increase while the value of the Transact ion declines and exposes you to substantial economic losses.  \n",
      "A Transaction and related Underlier may be priced in separate markets, and the values of the Transaction and Underlier may diverge for significant periods or indefinitely.  Also, models we use t o value Transactions, including methodologies, assumptions and inputs to \n",
      "those models, may change, which could cause a change to the value we attribute to the Transaction without necessarily affecting the value of the Underlier.  \n",
      "G. No assurance of Transact ions providing you with a desired return or result  \n",
      "Unless the terms of the Transaction expressly guarantee a stated return, there is no assurance that a Transaction will provide you with a positive or anticipated return or achieve your objectives.  It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the underlying rates, prices, assets, indices, or other Underliers relevant to a particular Transactions will rise or fall. The levels or performance of relevant rates, prices, assets, indices, or other Underliers may be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors. \n",
      "You should be willing to accept the risk of exposure to the levels or performance of such \n",
      "rates, prices, assets, indices, or other Underliers and the risk of suffering substantial economic losses from or in connection with the Transactions , which may require you to \n",
      " \n",
      "11 \n",
      " make a payment to us .  Even if the Transactions provide you with a positive or \n",
      "anticipated return, the return on the Transactions may be in ferior to returns available in \n",
      "connection with other Transactions that you could have entered into or other \n",
      "arrangements that you could have made, including owning the Underliers. \n",
      "H. No assurance of Transactions achieving your desired hedging objectives \n",
      "In some cases, you may enter into Transactions to hedge, reduce or otherwise manage \n",
      "price or other risks to which you or your affiliates are exposed through owning an asset, \n",
      "owing a liability or being a party to other transactions or anticipated transactions .  There \n",
      "may be imperfect correlation (sometimes referred to as “basis risk”) between changes in the value of a Transaction and the particular exposures you wish to hedge, and the amount of basis risk may increase over time.  You may also be exposed to ris k as a result \n",
      "of differences in legal documentation between a Transaction and the particular exposure you wish to hedge, including differences in how the Underlier is defined under the hedged item and the definition applicable to the Transaction, or as a r esult of differences \n",
      "in the dates or times as of which prices, values or levels are to be determined for the hedged item versus the Transaction.  \n",
      "In addition, the notional amount of a Transaction may not remain matched to the amount of exposure you wish to hedge, as would be the case, for example, if an anticipated investment, purchase, sale, acquisition, disposition or other transaction does not occur, or a loan or bond is pre -paid or called.  Unless otherwise agreed, we have no obligation to \n",
      "terminate o r modify any Transaction in response to these or other changes in your \n",
      "circumstances or to accommodate your hedging strategies or needs.  You should carefully review the risks of entering into a Transaction before you acquire an asset, liability or other i tem to be hedged and the risks of any prepayment, liquidation or other disposition \n",

      " J. General characteristics of variance-  and volatility- linked Transactions  \n",
      " Variance -linked Transactions  \n",
      "Variance is generally a measure of how widely dispersed the data points in a given data \n",
      "set are around their mean, or average, or around an assumed mean.  The variance of the data points in a given data set is generally calculated by:  \n",
      "(i) calculating the mean of the data points;  \n",
      "(ii) determ ining by how much each single data point deviates from that mean;  \n",
      "(iii) squaring that deviation in order to treat positive and negative deviations the same;  \n",
      "(iv) calculating the sum of all the squared deviations; and  \n",
      "(v) dividing that sum by the number of data points.  \n",
      "The result is the average squared deviation from the mean, which seeks to express, in a \n",
      "single number, the degree of variability of the data points in the applicable data set.  \n",
      "Under the terms of a variance- linked Transaction, variance will typically be calc ulated in \n",
      "a manner that is generally consistent with the description above, but with such specific terms and modifications as are specified for purposes of that Transaction.  Because different variance -linked Transactions define variance in different ways,  it is important to \n",
      "review and understand the manner in which variance is calculated under a particular variance- linked Transaction before entering into it.  \n",
      "A formula for the calculation of variance in a variance -linked Transaction will typically \n",
      "have the  following components:  \n",
      "• Specification of the data points to be observed.  The terms of the variance -linked \n",
      "Transaction will specify the price, level, rate or other value (collectively, the “price”) of the Underlier on which the variance calculation will be based , such as \n",
      "a rate, asset or index .  You should be aware of several technical factors that may \n",
      "affect the price of the Underlier on any given observation date and, therefore, may affect the calculated variance:  \n",
      "o Under the terms of certain variance- linked Transactions, if a disruption \n",
      "event (as defined under those terms) occurs on a date on which the price is to be observed, any published price may be disregarded and the calculation agent may have discretion to det ermine the price on that date.  \n",
      "Any price so determined will be taken into account in the calculation of variance.  If we are the calculation agent, we will have no obligation to take your interests into account in making that determination. \n",
      " \n",
      "14 \n",
      " o The Underlier may change over the term of the variance- linked \n",
      "Transaction in a way that affects its variance.  For example, if the \n",
      "Underlier is an index, the index may be reconstituted periodically, which may result in new components  with different variance characterist ics than \n",
      "the original components  of the index.  \n",
      "o The price source may change the manner in which it calculates the price, \n",
      "and that change may tend to increase or decrease the variance of the price.  \n",
      "o If the Underlier is traded on an exchange or other market, t he exchange or \n",
      "market may impose price limits, which would tend to reduce variance if those price limits are reached.  \n",
      "o For certain Underliers or types of Underliers, there may be additional adjustments or events that could affect the calculation of variance  or the \n",
      "prices used to calculate variance.  \n",
      "• Observation period .  The variance of the Underlier will be measured at the \n",
      "specified observation intervals over a specified observation period.  Relatively shorter observation periods and relatively longer observa tion periods each present \n",
      "their own risks.  In general, a shorter observation period is more sensitive to the effects of sudden market shocks and the “volatility clustering” phenomenon, which is the tendency of days with unusually high percentage changes f rom the \n",
      "prior day to occur together, and vice versa.  These sudden changes may have a significant effect on variance over a short -term period but may tend to be \n",
      "smoothed out over a longer period.  While a longer period is less sensitive to short -term shocks, a longer period is subject to the greater uncertainty associated \n",
      "with a longer future time horizon and the greater potential for significant events that are unforeseeable at the time of entering into the variance -linked Transaction.  \n",
      "• Observation interval .  The terms of the variance- linked Transaction will specify \n",
      "how frequently the price of the Underlier will be observed for purposes of the variance calculation.  Daily observations are common, but the price may be observed weekly, monthly or with some other frequency. The variance of a given Underlier over a given observation period will likely differ, perhaps significantly, depending on the interval at which the price is observed.  \n",
      "• Return.  Variance is typically calculated not by reference to the change in  the \n",
      "absolute price of the Underlier, but rather by reference to the percentage change in the price over the relevant observation interval.  This percentage change is typically expressed as a “log return,” which is calculated by applying the natural logari thm function to the ratio of one observed price to the prior observed price, \n",
      "rather than as a “simple return,” which is simply the percentage change from one observed price to the next.  Although the log return and the simple return are similar for small c hanges from one observed price to the next, they will diverge \n",
      "from each other to a greater degree the greater the change.  The log return is always less than the simple return.  In the case of an increase from one observed \n",
      " \n",
      "15 \n",
      " price to the next, this means tha t, other relevant variables being constant, the log \n",
      "return would result in  a lower variance than the simple return.  In the case of a \n",
      "decrease from one observed price to the next, other relevant variables being \n",
      "constant, the log return would result in  a greater variance than the simple return, \n",
      "because the lower log return would be more negative and, when squared, would produce a greater number than the square of the greater (but less negative) simple return.  \n",
      "• Variability around actual or assumed mean.  Under  many variance- linked \n",
      "Transactions, variance is calculated based on the variability of returns around an assumed mean of zero, rather than around the actual mean of the returns.  If variance is calculated for a particular variance- linked Transaction based on the \n",
      "average of squared log returns rather than the average of the squared deviation of each log return from the mean of log returns, then variance is being calculated with an assumed mean of zero.  \n",
      "If the actual mean of returns differs from zero, that ma y have a significant effect \n",
      "on the calculation of variance.  Calculating variance with an assumed mean of zero will tend to produce a greater variance than if the actual mean were used —\n",
      "the more so the greater the difference between zero and the actual mean .  If \n",
      "markets trend steadily in one direction or another, there is likely to be a difference between zero and the actual mean, and that difference will be greater the more steady and the more pronounced the trend.  For example, a steady 1% daily increase i n an Underlier price would result in an average deviation of 1% from an \n",
      "assumed mean of zero, but in an average deviation from the actual mean (which would be 1%) of 0%.  Variance -linked Transactions with shorter observation \n",
      "periods are more likely to disp lay a divergence of the actual mean from zero.  \n",
      "• Average.  As discussed above, variance is the average of squared deviations from an actual or assumed mean.  The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the squared deviations by a number commonly referre d to under the terms of a \n",
      "variance- linked Transaction as “N” (or “N – 1”), which typically represents the \n",
      "expected number of observations that will occur over the observation period but may be a different number negotiated by the parties to the variance -linked \n",
      "Transaction.  The terms of a variance- linked Transaction will specify whether an \n",
      "adjustment is made to N in the event of a disruption event.  \n",
      "o Under certain variance- linked Transactions, N will not be adjusted if the \n",
      "actual number of observations turns out to be less than N (or N – 1, as \n",
      "applicable) expected as of the date the Transaction is entered into, as a \n",
      "result of disruption events that cause the price of the Underlier to be unavailable or otherwise disregarded for a given observation day.  Instead , \n",
      "the price of the Underlier on the disrupted day may be assumed to be the same as it was on the previous non- disrupted day.  This approach to \n",
      "disrupted days will tend to smooth returns and therefore reduce variance.  Prolonged price disruptions may lead t o a significant reduction in \n",
      "variance.  \n",
      " \n",
      "16 \n",
      " o Under certain other variance -linked Transactions, if a disrupted day \n",
      "occurs, that day will be disregarded for purposes of the variance \n",
      "calculation and N will be reduced by 1.  This approach to disrupted days may also affect the variance calculation, tending to reduce variance in circumstances where a significant decline on a disrupted day is followed by a recovery on the next non- disrupted day, and tending to increase \n",
      "variance where a significant decline on a disrupted  day is followed by \n",
      "another significant decline on the next non- disrupted day.  \n",
      "• Annualization.   Variance is typically expressed on an annualized basis.  This is achieved by multiplying the average variance over the applicable observation interval by an annualization factor that represents the number of such observation intervals expected to occur i n one year, or that is otherwise negotiated by the \n",
      "parties to the variance- linked Transaction.  \n",
      "Variance risk may arise from many types of transactions, including Transactions referencing equities, credit, commodities, rates and foreign currencies.  If your  objective \n",

      "volat ility squared.  Because variance is volatility squared, the payout  on a variance- linked \n",
      "Transaction is a “convex” function of volatility.

      "increase in volatility.  \n",
      "At any time during the term of a variance -linked Transaction, its value will reflect the \n",
      "actual realized variance up to that time and an expectation about variance over the remaining term of the variance -linked Transaction, which may be determined based on \n",
      "the variance implied in the price of market -traded instruments referencing the applicable \n",

      "K. General characteristics of correlation -linked Transactions  \n",
      "Correlation is a statistical measure of the extent to which the changes in the prices of two or more Underliers, such as rates, assets or indices,  over a specified period of time are \n",
      "similar to each other in terms of timing, direction and magnitude .  The correlation among \n",
      "two or more Underliers  is represented by a number called the “correlation co efficient,” \n",
      "which is often denoted by the Greek letter ρ.  The correlation coefficient will always be between –1 and 1, where a value near 1 indicates that the Underliers  are strongly  \n",
      "positively correlated; a value near –1 indicates that the Underliers  are strongly  inversely \n",
      "correlated; and a value near 0 indicates that the Underliers  are weakly correlated (either \n",
      "positively or inversely) or uncorrelated.  If the prices of two Underliers  tend to increase at \n",
      "the same time and decrease at the same time and by similar percentages, those two \n",
      "Underliers  are strongly positively correlated with each other.  If this tendency is low, the \n",
      "two Underliers  are weakly correlated, and if the two Underli ers exhibit the opposite of \n",
      "this tendency, they are inversely correlated.  Correlation is an indication of the extent to which the prices  of two or more  Underliers  are influenced by the same factors.   \n",
      "The correlation between the data points in two data se ries is the covariance of those data \n",
      "points, scaled so that it is a number between –1 and 1.  The concept of covariance builds on the concept of variance, which is described in Section II. J – “General characteristics of \n",
      "variance-  and volatility -linked Transactions” above.  Whereas variance is a measure of \n",
      "the variability of the data points in a single data series around their mean, covariance is a measure of how similar the variability of the data points in one data series is to the variability of the data points in another data series, in terms of the timing  and direction of \n",
      "deviations from their respective means.  \n",
      "The first step in the calculation of correlation is the calculation of covariance.  The calculation of covariance is similar to the calculation o f variance, except that it accounts \n",
      "for deviations in two data series instead of just one.  As an example, the covariance of the daily returns of asset A and asset B over a specified period would generally be calculated by: \n",
      " \n",
      "19 \n",
      " (i) calculating the mean of the dail y returns of asset A and asset B;  \n",
      "(ii) for each relevant day in the period, determining by how much the daily returns \n",
      "of asset A and asset B on that day deviate from their respective means;  \n",
      "(iii) for each relevant day in the period, multiplying the deviation of the daily return of asset A from its mean (the “asset A deviation”) by the deviation of the daily return of asset B from its mean (the “asset B deviation”);  \n",
      "(iv) calculating the sum of the resulting product for all relevant days in the period; and \n",
      "(v) dividing that sum by the number of relevant days in the period. \n",
      "The result (i.e., the covariance) is the average of the product on each relevant day of the asset A deviation multiplied by the asset B deviation.  On any given day, this product will be positive if both deviat ions are positive or both are negative, and will be a greater \n",
      "number the greater the deviation for either.  Conversely, on any given day, this product will be negative if one has a positive deviation but the other has a negative deviation, and it will be more negative the greater the absolute value of either deviation.  \n",
      "Once covariance has been calculated, correlation may be calculated by dividing covariance by the product of the volatility of asset A and the volatility of asset B over the relevant period.  This step has the effect of normalizing covariance —that is, scaling it so \n",
      "that it is a number between –1 and 1.  It also causes correlation to reflect not only a relationship between the relevant assets in terms of the direction and timing of fluctuations,  but also a relationship in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations.  In other \n",
      "words, unlike covariance, correlation will tend to be greater if fluctuations in the same \n",

      "Market risk is the risk that the value of a Transaction, or the amount of payments or deliveries to be made under  a Transaction, will be adversely affected by fluctuations  in \n",
      "the level or volatility of, or correlation or relationship between, one or more market prices, rates or indices or other market factors, by new information related to an Underlier or changes in perceptions regarding contingencies affecting an Underlier, or by illiquidity \n",
      "in the market for the Underlier or the Transaction or in a related market.   \n",
      "Depending on the terms of a specific Transaction, its value may be affected by multiple factors in addition to the prices, values, or levels of the Underliers.  In general, the amount that other market participants may be willing to pay or receive to acquire and assume exposure to the cash flows or delivery obligations  and rights under a Tran saction \n",
      "depends in part on market conditions and prices, values and levels for comparable Transactions prevailing at the time of valuation.  For example, because future cash flows must be discounted at an appropriate rate to determine their present value, the value of Transactions will generally depend on interest rates and yield curves in the relevant currency , which in turn will reflect expectations of future inflation and other market \n",
      "factors .  The choice of an appropriate discount rate may be affected b y the collateral or \n",
      " \n",
      "21 \n",
      " other credit support arrangements in place for a Transaction or group of Transactions.  \n",
      "Interest rates and yield curves may also influence the value of a Transaction through their effect on the cost of funding positions in an Underlier or related instrument in order to hedge a future payment or delivery obligation under the Transaction.  Transactions with option- like payouts will generally be affected by the volatility of the price or level of the \n",
      "Underlier, which volatility is also subj ect to changing market conditions. The value of \n",
      "Transactions under which the payout depends on the cumulative effect of events related to multiple Underliers (such as tranched or Nth -to-default credit default swaps, as \n",
      "described in the Disclosure Annex for  Credit Derivative Transactions , or Transactions \n",
      "under which the stated return is determined as the best or worst from among a set of Underliers) will generally depend on the correlations between the Underliers.  The value of a portfolio of Transactions wi ll depend on the interaction of multiple factors, including \n",
      "cash or collateral flows under related credit support arrangements.  \n",
      "In addition to prices, values, or levels of the Underliers, factors that may affect the value of a Transaction (and, in some cases, the value of the Underlier itself) include:  \n",
      "• actual and/or expected volatilities (i.e., the frequency and magnitude of cha nges) \n",
      "in the prices, values, or levels of the Underliers;  \n",
      "• correlation (i.e., the tendency to move together in the same or opposite directions) of the prices, values, or levels of the Underliers;  \n",
      "• market interest rates, currency exchange rates, forward r ates and yield and \n",
      "forward price curves;  \n",
      "• dividend rates, expected dividend rates and corporate events relating to \n",
      "Underliers, if applicable;  \n",
      "• liquidity in the markets for Transactions and Underliers or in related markets;  \n",
      "• the term of the Transaction; \n",
      "• optionality that a party has under the terms of a Transaction and its governing documentation, including but not limited to optional early termination rights or rights to choose which particular securities, commodities, currencies, or other assets it may  deliver in satisfaction of an obligation;  \n",
      "• the terms of collateral or other credit support arrangements, including whether a party is permitted to re -use collateral and the rights to choose the composition of \n",
      "the credit support it is required to deliver;  \n",
      "• in the case of cleared Transactions, the clearinghouse’s margining methodology, including in particular its method, if any, of adjusting for imputed interest on cumulative variation margin;  \n",
      "• actions of government, regulatory and tax authorities; and  \n",
      " \n",
      "22 \n",
      " • our creditworthiness or your creditworthiness, whether actual or perceived, \n",
      "including actual or anticipated upgrades or downgrades in a party’s credit ratings or changes in other credit measures.  \n",
      "The market risk of a Transaction may be accentuated by com plex payout calculations or \n",
      "other features.  Transactions with such features may be subject to significant changes in value as a result of relatively small changes in the price, value, or level of an Underlier or other market factors.  Such features includ e leverage, multipliers, option- like payouts, \n",
      "non-linear dependence on an underlying price, value, or level, or dependence on the path \n",
      "of an underlying price, value, or level.  Transactions with such features may include caps, collars, floors, exotic options, Transactions with knock- in or knock- out rights, or ra nge \n",
      "accrual swaps and options. \n",
      "Furthermore, inflation may also reduce the value of any payments that you receive under \n",
      "a Transaction compared to your expectations when entering into the Transaction.  \n",
      "B. Transactions involve liquidity risk   \n",
      "Liquidity risk is the risk that a party may be unable to, or may  have limited ability to , \n",
      "unwind or transfer a particular position in a timely manner at or near the market price or at all.  Liquidity risk may vary greatly depending upon the terms of the Transaction, including, for example, notional amounts, rates, collateralization, highly customized features and other market sensitive terms.  \n",
      "In evaluating this risk in the context of Transactions, you should consider  that a \n",
      "Transaction may be terminated or modified only pursuant to the terms of the Transaction or by mutual agreement of the parties.  Similarly, any novation or other transfer of a \n",
      "Transaction may be made only pursuant to the terms of  the Transaction or with the \n",
      "consent of the remaining party and, in either case, on terms agreed between the transferor and transferee.  If our consent is required, we may not consent for a variety of reasons, which we may not be required to disclose to you.  \n",
      "Even though marke t-makers and dealers are likely to  quote prices or terms for entering \n",
      "into or terminating particular Transactions and provide indicative prices or mid -market \n",
      "valuations for outstanding Transactions, there can be no assurance that another dealer will be ava ilable and willing to accept as transferee your rights and obligations under any \n",
      "Transaction between us, or that we would consent to such transfer. Even though market liquidity may exist generally for a particular type of uncleared Transaction at the time you enter into the Transaction, such liquidity may be diminished or unavailable in the future as more Transactions become cleared.  Market liquidity for a type of Transaction may also be adversely affected by the development of updated or new industry standard terms, their adoption by market participants (including through amendments to outstanding Transactions via industry protocols) and the migration of trading interest to such new or updated standard terms.  \n",
      "There also can be no assurance that another de aler or market participant will be available \n",
      "and willing to offer you transactions that offset your Transactions with us.  Even if an \n",
      " \n",
      "23 \n",
      " offsetting transaction is available, in the case of an uncleared Transaction, engaging in \n",
      "such an offsetting transaction ( whether bilaterally or through a swap execution facility) \n",
      "will not automatically close out your Transaction with us (as might occur in the case of cleared transactions carried at the same clearing broker) and may not function as an effective hedge for that Transaction.  Accordingly, it may not be possible for you to \n",
      "modify, terminate or offset your obligations or your exposure to the risks associated with a particular Transaction prior to its scheduled termination date.   \n",
      "In contrast, liquidity risk may be mitigated to a degree when a Transaction  is cleared on a \n",
      "derivatives clearing organization or other clearinghouse, insofar as your ability to close \n",
      "out your T ransaction by entering into an offsetting transaction with other market \n",
      "participants would not require our consent or an existing trading relationship between us and that other market participant.  However, there can be no assurance that the level of liquidity for a cleared Transaction you enter into will continue to exist.  Your ability to clear Transactions on a derivatives clearing organization or other clearinghouse in the future will depend upon a variety of factors, including the willingness of futures commission merchants to offer you clearing services, which could depend, among other things, on the level of your creditworthiness and your ability to meet margin calls.  \n",
      "C. Certain Transactions may be subject to restrictions on transfer under securities laws  \n",
      "Certain Transactions (including security- based swaps generally) may be securities, \n",
      "or may co nstitute offers or sales of securities, under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as \n",
      "amended (the “Securities Act”) or other applicable securities laws.  Such Transactions will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities l aws \n",
      "and, therefore, the transfer of Transactions may be prohibited or restricted by such laws.  \n",
      "Such Transactions will be entered into, modified or terminated pursuant to exemptions \n",
      "from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4 (a)(2) of that Act and/or \n",
      "Regulation D or another available exemption.  You may be required to represent in the \n",
      "terms of the Transactions or other governing documentation that you are not entering into \n",
      "such Transactions with a view to resale or distribution in violation of applicable securities laws.   \n",
      "D. Engaging in Transactions may subject you to funding risk \n",
      "Funding risk is the risk that, as a result of the unpredictability of payment or delivery \n",
      "obligations or margin (collateral) requirements under Transactions, or mismatches or delays in the timing of cash flows due from or to a p arty pursuant to Transactions or \n",
      "related hedging, trading, collateral or other transactions or activities, a party may not have adequate cash available to fund current obligations. \n",
      "For example, if you are required to post margin (collateral) and the market moves against \n",
      "your position or the required level of margin is increased by us or, in the case of a cleared Transaction , by a clearinghouse or your clearing broker, you could be called upon to post  \n",
      "additional margin (collateral) within applicable notice p eriods (which may be short) in \n",
      "order to maintain your position, subject in each case to the terms of the Transaction and \n",

      "under a Transaction or provide the additional require d funds to meet a margin call within \n",
      "the prescribed time (taking into account any applicable notice requirements and grace periods), the governing documentation may provide that the Transaction and possibly your entire relationship with us may be terminate d, potentially requiring a termination \n",
      "payment by you. \n",
      "Depending upon your other arrangements with us or with your other creditors, such \n",
      "failure to comply or such termination  may also trigger cross -default provisions in these \n",
      "other arrangements, which may provide us or your other creditors with rights to \n",
      "accelerate or terminate these other arrangements, possibly increasing your funding risk to the extent you are required to make additional payments or deliveries.   \n",
      "E. Credit risk of named counterparty (and any applicable guarantors or credit support providers), prime broker, clearing broker or clearinghouse \n",
      "Credit risk is the risk that a party to a Transaction or, if applicable, a party’s guarantor or credit support provider, will fail to perform its obligations when due, including its obligations to return collateral which it is no longer entitled to hold, or that the amount of collateral provided by that party or its credit support provider proves insufficient.  Because of this credit risk, our and your cre ditworthiness and that of our and your \n",
      "guarantor or other credit support provider, if any, is a material consideration in entering into or determining the terms of a Transaction, and has an impact on the pricing, costs or credit enhancement of the Transact ion.  A party’s exposure to credit risk, if so agreed, \n",
      "may be reduced by the delivery to it or to its custodian of collateral to secure the obligations of the other party or its guarantor or credit support provider, and the other party’s exposure to credit  risk for the return of such collateral may be reduced by \n",
      "delivering such collateral to such custodian to be held under mutually acceptable \n",
      "custodial arrangements, subject to the credit risk of the custodian as discussed below.  \n",
      "Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing or required by applicable law, neither your counterparty nor any guarantor or credit support provider for your counterparty will have any obligation to deliver collateral in connection with the Transactions . \n",
      "We refer to the entity that is  specified as your counterparty in the documentation \n",
      "evidencing a Transaction, and in whose name that documentation is executed, as your “named counterparty.”  Unless we have expressly agreed in writing to another arrangement, no affiliate of your named counterparty or any other entity will issue, endorse or guarantee, make payments or deliveries, or otherwise perform or assume any liability for obligations in respect of a Transaction.  For the avoidance of doubt, this applies equally to Transactions where we act or an affiliate of ours acts as agent for a different legal entity that is the named counterparty.  Accordingly, the Transactions are subject to your named counterparty’s credit risk.  In the event, however, that the named counterparty’s payment or delivery obligations under or in connection with the \n",
      "Transactions are guaranteed by any guarantor or credit support provider, the satisfaction of such paym ent or delivery obligations is also s ubject to the credit risk of such guarantor \n",

      "25 \n",

      "“cleared Transactions”.  For prime brokerage Transactions, your named counterparty \n",
      "generally will be the prime broker and, unless otherwise agreed, we shall have no liability for your prime broker’s performance of its obligations to you.  The consequences of a Transaction not being accepted by a prime broker, clearing broker or clearinghouse will be governed by applicable law and the terms of any agreement between you and us.  You should be aware that an agreement on the terms of a Transaction for giv e-up or clearing \n",
      "that is not accepted by the prime broker, clearing broker or clearinghouse might result in there not being an outstanding Transaction between you and us, although governing documentation or applicable law may provide for the payment of com pensation amounts \n",

      "Upon entering into any Transaction with your named counterparty, your ability to subsequently clear such Transaction on a clearinghouse or to novate your position in an uncleared Transaction to another dealer or mar ket participant, and the cost thereof to you \n",
      "or the value you may receive in connection with any such novation, may be influenced by the creditworthiness of your named counterparty and, if applicable, any guarantor or other credit support provider for your  named counterparty.  Your ability to clear or \n",

      "case of preferred securities, no maturity).  They may be issued by states and \n",

      "periodically to the rate produced in an Auction that is governed by a set of Auction \n",
      "Procedures established by the issuer and its Auction Agent and described in the offering \n",

      "days, 90 days, 180 days or longer are also possible.  Under some programs, the issuer \n",
      "may change the reset period to a multi-year period.  Any change in the reset period \n",
